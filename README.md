### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey! Iâ€™m a Software Engineer focused on building data systems, based in the SF Bay Area. I work on things like data pipelines, predictive inventory systems, and making analytics more practical for real-world problems. In my free time, Iâ€™m building an autograd library called [punytorch](https://www.github.com/jdblackstar/punytorch). Previously, I worked on fixing food with [Everytable](https://www.everytable.com/), improving teamwork at [KeeperAI](https://keeperai.com/), and developing navigation tech at [PNI Sensor](https://www.pnicorp.com/).
