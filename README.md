### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey! Iâ€™m a Software Engineer focused on building data systems, based in the SF Bay Area. I work on things like data pipelines, predictive inventory systems, and making analytics more practical for real-world problems. In my free time, Iâ€™m building an autograd library called punytorch. Previously, I worked on fixing food with Everytable, improving teamwork at KeeperAI, and developing navigation tech at PNI Sensor.
